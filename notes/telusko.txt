#3 Python Tutorial for Beginners | Getting Started with Python

	 *integer division or float division "//"
	 	it will give just the integer back

	 	5 //2 = 2

	 *power of **

	 	2**3 = 8 

#4 Python Tutorial for Beginners | Variables in Python

		store value 

		assignment

		** output of the previous operation 

		user under score "_" 

		example :

		 _ + y

	Variable type String :

	 name = "hell wolrd"

	 **string concate	with +

	 		name +"hello world"

	 -string itselft is an array so we can get the the value of every index

	 		name[0] 

	 	* if we start with negative index it will start from last index

	 			name = "fahim"

	 			name[-1] "m"

	 	*print between index like 0 - 5 index

	 			name[0:5]

	 			** if you don't specify the end it will print till last 

	 					name[0:]

	 			** and if we don't have the starting part it will start form first and till the point

	 					name[:4]

	 			**string in python is immutable - it means you can not replace certain value 

	 	*length of a string 

	 			len(name)

#5 Python Tutorial for Beginners | List in Python

		list is basically array 


		nums = [15,30,25,60,17,36]

		everythin we done with string as a array works here too

		*string array 

				names = ['fahim','naiem','mukim']

		*** in list we can have data of different type 

			values = ['fahim',25,2.5]

		** we can perform different operation on the list 

			**list are mutable so we can add , remove etc

			-nums.append(45);

				it will add 45 at end of the list 

			-insert

				nums.insert(2,77)

				it will be inserted at index 2

			-remove 

				nums.remove(14)

				it will be remove the value 14 from the list

			-pop 

				pop will remove value form the list based on index or end of the list like a stack 

					-with index

						nums.pop(4)

						it will remove the value from index 4

					- normal pop will remove the last value from the list like stack

			-del() it will help you delete multiple value

				del nums[2:]

					it means delete all the value from 3 index to last

			-* add multiple values 

				nums.extend([20,25])

			-in build methods

				-min 

					min(nums)

				-max
					max(nums)

				-sum(nums)

				-sort

					nums.sort()

#6 Python Tutorial for Beginners | Tuple | Set in Python


	touple is like list which is collection of data in a array .

	but in list we can change different values and stauff but in case of touple we can not 

	*so we call it immutable

	**declearing a touple

		tup = (21,3,3,6)

		so in list we use squre brekets but in here we use round one

	-two method ar available 

		-index

			tup.index(2)

			it will return the index of 2

		-count 

			tup.count(4)

				count the number of occurence of 4

	**faster execution

	--set 

		collection of elements mean collection of unique elements

		*concenpt of hash

		*declear 

			s  = {1,2,3,4,5}

		*indexing is not supported . beacuse there is no proper sequence 

		-explore the set function

	help('name of topics')


#8 Python Tutorial for Beginners | More on Variables in Python

	**address of a variable

		num = 5

		use id(num) it will give us a address

	** if python have the same data then the address will be same

#9 Python Tutorial for Beginners | Data Types in Python

	none
		not assigned to any value
	numeric

		int float complex bool

		complex number

		type(num)
	List
	Tuple
	Set
	String
	Range

		range(0,10)

		list = list(range(10))

	Dictionary

		d = {'name':'fahik'}

		d.name

#10 Python Tutorial for Beginners | Operators in Python

	arithmetic operators

		+,-,/,*

	Assignment

		x = 2 

		x += 2

		-one line multiple assignment

			a,b = 5,6

	Unary operator

		unary 

			n = -n

	relational operator

		a < b 

		a >b 

		a == b

		a >= b 

		a <= b

		a != b 

	Logical operator

		 and , or , not




#11 Python Tutorial for Beginners | Number System Conversion in Python

	-convert binary

		bin(25);
		 -'ob1101'

		 here 'ob' represent binary

	-convert to octal

		oct(25)

			0o31

		here 0o represent octal

	-convert hex

		hex(25)

		0x
